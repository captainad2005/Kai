![Kai Logo](logo-placeholder.png)

## Overview

Kai is an advanced personal finance visualization tool that empowers you to see the long-term impact of your financial decisions. By creating a detailed model of your current finances and allowing you to explore alternate scenarios, Kai transforms abstract financial planning into a concrete, actionable experience.

Think of Kai as your personal financial time machine ‚Äî it allows you to peer into possible futures based on different choices, and even look backward to understand how past decisions have shaped your current situation.

## Key Features

### üîÆ Multiple Financial Futures
Visualize different "what-if" scenarios with interactive timelines showing how career changes, investment strategies, major purchases, or lifestyle adjustments would affect your financial trajectory over time.

### üìä Behavior-Based Analytics
Unlike traditional financial planning tools that assume perfect behavior, Kai learns your actual spending patterns and habits, incorporating them into realistic projections that account for your real-world behavior.

### üß† AI Financial Advisor
Receive personalized recommendations from Kai's AI advisor, which analyzes your specific financial situation, goals, and behavioral patterns to suggest optimizations tailored uniquely to you.

### üï∞Ô∏è Financial Rewind
Examine the long-term impact of past financial decisions with retrospective analysis. Understand how different choices would have affected your current position and learn valuable lessons for future planning.

### üîí Privacy-First Design
Kai never sells your financial data to institutions or third parties. Your sensitive information stays on your device with bank-level encryption, giving you peace of mind while planning your financial future.

### ‚ö° Real-Time Scenario Comparison
Compare multiple financial scenarios side-by-side with intuitive visualizations that clearly illustrate the differences in outcomes over your selected timeframe.
